Task requires two different implementations:
1. Functional approach;
2. Object-oriented approach(with recursion);

Both have to be covered with tests(stored in one file for convenience).

Object-oriented implementation covered with unittests

Simply run using:
```
python -m unittest discover -s unittests -p '*_test.py'
```
Functional implementation covered with pytest (can be installed using ```pip install pytest```)

Run using:
```
pytest pytest_tests 
```
